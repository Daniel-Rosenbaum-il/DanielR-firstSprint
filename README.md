# Minesweeper game

This was one of the first sprints that I did in my studies.

I used Html, CSS, and vanilla js, I made some changes to the code since then, but try to keep as much of the original code as I can, most of the changes was in the CSS for better UI experience and responsiveness

For the background, I took a CSS code from Codepen made by: Vikas Bhardwaj

Boat in ocean: Pure CSS animation and transition

Game rules:

Minesweeper rules are very simple. The board is divided into cells, with mines randomly distributed. To win, you need to open all the cells. The number on a cell shows the number of mines adjacent to it. Using this information, you can determine safe cells, and cells that contain a mine. Cells suspected of being mines can be marked with a flag using the right mouse button.
